# Nodejs Expressjs MongoDB Ready-to-use API Project Structure
A ready-to-use boilerplate for REST API Development with Node.js, Express, and MongoDB

## Getting started


This is a basic API skeleton written in JavaScript ES2015. Very useful to building a RESTful web APIs for your front-end platforms like Android, iOS or JavaScript frameworks (Angular, Reactjs, etc).

This project will run on **NodeJs** using **MongoDB** as database. I had tried to maintain the code structure easy as any beginner can also adopt the flow and start building an API. Project is open for suggestions, Bug reports and pull requests. 

## Features

-   Basic Authentication (Register/Login with hashed password)
-   JWT Tokens, make requests with a token after login with `Authorization` header with value `Bearer yourToken` where `yourToken` will be returned in Login response.
-   Pre-defined response structures with proper status codes.
-   Included CORS.
-    **Book** example with **CRUD** operations.
-   Validations added. 
-   Included API collection for Postman.
-   Light-weight project.

## Software Requirements

-   Node.js **10+**
-   MongoDB **3.6+** (Recommended **4+**)
## How to install

### Using Git (recommended)

1.  Clone the project from github. Change "myproject" to your project name.

```bash
git clone --depth=1 --branch=master https://github.com/maitraysuthar/rest-api-nodejs-mongodb.git ./myproject
rm -rf ./myproject/.git
```

### Using manual download ZIP

1.  Download repository
2.  Uncompress to your desired directory

### Install npm dependencies after installing (Git or manual download)

```bash
cd myproject
npm install
npm update
```

### Setting up environments

1.  You will find a file named `.env.example` on root directory of project.
2.  Create a new file by copying and pasting the file and then renaming it to just `.env`
3.  The file `.env` is already ignored, so you never commit your credentials.
4.  Change the values of the file to your environment.

## How to run

### Running  API server locally

```bash
npm run dev
```

You will know server is running by checking the output of the command `npm run dev`

```bash
Connected to mongodb:YOUR_DB_CONNECTION_STRING
App is running ...

Press CTRL + C to stop the process.
```
**Note:**  `YOUR_DB_CONNECTION_STRING` will be your MongoDB connection string.

### Creating new models

If you need to add more models to the project just create a new file in `/models/` and use them in the controllers.

### Creating new routes

If you need to add more routes to the project just create a new file in `/routes/` and add it in `/routes/api.js` it will be loaded dynamically.

### Creating new controllers

If you need to add more controllers to the project just create a new file in `/controllers/` and use them in the routes.
